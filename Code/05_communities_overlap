data (kerinci)

# convert the time in hour of the day, the number we see is a range from 0 to 1.
# let's create a new field that is the time in radiance

kerinci$Timecirc <- kerinci$Time * 2 * pi 
# $ to assign, * for multiplication, 
# $ was necessary to create a new column

# now we want to set only the tiger data with symbol "==" to select only tiger path

# [] to select
# the "," to close the query

# now we do a density plot together
# for the density plot we relate the time to the tigers 
# first we set time for tiger, it is in the coloun Timecirc

tigertime <- tiger$Timecirc # it takes the time only of the tigers 
densityPlot(tigertime) 

# let's do the same for another species and then overlap 
# macaque

# exercise: select the data for the macaque in the kerinci set and assign them to a new object 

macaque <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="macaque",] # == means equal, and != means not equal

# exercise: select the time for the macaque data and make a density plot

# now we can overlap the 2 graphs to see how much they're temporarly overlapped
# function overlap
