# we are at population levels and individuals of the same species, about popolations we talked about density and distribution 
# next level is about communities: different individuals from different species, next week ecosystems.
# once u're dealing with communities u deal with plots, measures in squares, reading table 
# from tables we're moving to graphs, to understand ho species live together, then multivariate analysis for showing how much individuals are dealt with each other 
# presentation on duccio github account 
# imagine we go to field and we visit some plots, 3 plots in this case, in any of them we mesure the information about species (SEE PRESENTATION MULTIVARIATE). in plot 1 15 individuals, plot n2 2, plot n3 3 of Orchys, final species Larix decidua plot1: 3, plot2: 10, plot 3: 8. Parnassius plot1: 13, plot2:1, plot3:2. 
# we can put the data in a matrix of plotxspecies. from the table we can pass to something graphical to understand how individuals are related to each other. plot1 is axe1, plot2 axe2, plot3 axe3, there are some species more related to each other like the orchys and the butterflies because of impollination.
# what would happen if we had 4 plots? we can only see things in 3 dimensions, so a fourth plot cannot be added to a graph of 3 dimensions (X,Y,Z). to face the problem we can pack the system to something we can visualize.
# 4 ore more plots in lower number of dimensions doing ECOGRAPHY
# let's imagine an X axe and Y axe, in this 2 axes we have several individuals with a certain distribution, the X axe is containing 50% of all range, Y axe other 50% (ha disegnato un grafico cartesiano con una striscia di punti in diagonale dall'origine), then we draw a line from origin to top right called component1 and another from top left to down right called component2 -> creating component we change the originals system passing from X/Y to more asses -> PCA PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. 
# PCA is one of multivariate analysis and helps to pass froma  system made of multidimensions to one made by 2 dimensions, and from 2 dimensions to 1 dimensions.
# we get a system with several species and compact them with pc1 (principal component) and pc2
# package used: vegan (vegetation analysis)
